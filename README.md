# TracolorieProject
It's purely Vanilla JavaScript app that uses the Module Design Pattern.


The app is composed of 4 controllers:
#
**The storage Controller deals with adding, updating,deleting items from Local Storage.
#
**The Item Controller deals with the actual data,the state.
#
**the UI Controller to work with the UI(Showing ,hiding things from UI and getting input values..).**
#
**The App Controller(or the initializer),where everything will meet...
